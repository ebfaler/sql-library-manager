# sql-library-manager
 Unit 8 Project Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree

I have created an application for a libaray which allows it to manage the collection of books.

The application allows a user to include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. To create this dynamic website, I have used JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

Areas where I have exceeded the project requirements:

* Added a case insensitive search feature which allows a user to search by Title, Author, Genre and Year.
* Added pagination to home page and search results.
